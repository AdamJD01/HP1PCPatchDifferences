==================================================================
Installing DirectX 8.0
==================================================================

If you declined to install DirectX 8.0 when initially installing
Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, you can at a later time 
by running "dxsetup.exe" located in the "DirectX" folder on the 
CDROM.


==================================================================
Troubleshooting
==================================================================

DirectX 8.0

It is highly recommended that you install DirectX 8.0 from your
Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone install disk as 
DirectX 8.0 is known to resolve a number of video card and other
graphical issues.

Video Card Drivers

Some video card drivers do not support Direct3D correctly. Typical
problems that may occur with these drivers include:

	- Crashing on starting up
	- Crashing when changing video resolutions
	- Corrupted textures
	- Unexpected bright flashing on screen
	- Unusually slow performance.

The solution is to go to your video card manufacturer's website
and download updated drivers for your card. It is highly
recommended that, given an option, you download and install
Microsoft-certified (WHQL) drivers.


==================================================================
Improving Game Play Performance
==================================================================

Some machines will benefit from experimenting with your
video/sound options:

	- Try lowering the texture detail inside the 'Options'
	  menu. This is particularly useful for computers with 
 	  less than 128 MB of RAM.

	- If your video resolution is greater than 640x480, try
	  reducing it to 640x480 in 'Options' menu.

	- If your colour bit depth is 32 bits, try reducing it to
	  16 bits in your video menu.


==================================================================
Other Issues
==================================================================

Sound:

Music/Sound volume sliders are located in the 'Audio' section of
the 'Options' menu.  The sliders give you the ability to adjust the 
various game volume levels.

Keyboard Controls:

Some PC keyboards cannot recognise certain combinations of 3 or
more simultaneously pressed keys.
To resolve this you may redefine your control keys through the 
'Options' menu.  Should you decide to change controls away from 
the default configuration some of the tutorial messages will refer 
to the original default keys rather than the new settings.
