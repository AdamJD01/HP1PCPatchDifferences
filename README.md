# HP1PCPatchDifferences

There are two versions of HP1 PC, a pre-patched version and a post-patched version which got released in different languages arbitrarily. The aim of this is to compare the differences between the two and this repo only contains files that are different. 

<br> So far just the different maps exported as t3d files have been added. I had originally planned for Github to compare the differences between these files but because some are too big for Github to compare I have added them separately in different folders instead. You can use WinMerge to compare them yourself. </br>
