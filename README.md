# HP1PCPatchDifferences

There are two versions of HP1 PC, a pre-patched version and a post-patched version which got released in different languages arbitrarily. The aim of this is to compare the differences between the two and this repo only contains files that are different. 

<br> All the different files have been added which include maps exported as t3d files, the U file contents, the DLL exports as text files and more. Some of the maps are too big for Github to compare so I added them separately in different folders, you can use WinMerge to compare them yourself. </br>
